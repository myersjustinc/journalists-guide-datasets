Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
==============================================

The [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) is a collection of surveys for most of the colleges and universities in the United States. It's conducted by the [National Center for Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/), which is a part of the [U.S. Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/).

The IPEDS collection is mandatory for any institution that participates in [federal student financial aid programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IV). Other institutions can (and do) choose to report to IPEDS, mostly because that's how they get included in federal data tools such as [College Navigator](http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/) that are more geared toward prospective students and their families.
